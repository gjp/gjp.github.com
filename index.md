# Hi.

I'm Gregory Parkhurst. I've been doing various things with software
for a long time, as a consultant more often than not:
C coding (back before the .com dinosaurs ruled the earth),
MySQL and Oracle database administration and tuning,
and Ruby & Rails development.

I've met many people I'd call better programmers, but not so many experienced generalists.

Last year I reached a turning point: I decided to become a contributor to open source rather than
remaining primarily a tool-user and bit wrangler within closed systems. This led me to
[Mendicant University](/mendicant.html).

# 2012:

I'm looking for a new challenge and closer involvement with a team.
If you're looking for the sort of person who can write and discuss code, tune a database,
provision a server in his basement, and have a lively and opinionated discussion
about both UI design and whether pushing bare-metal virtualization to the desktop makes sense,
perhaps we should talk.

      "I can't believe that!" said Alice.

      "Can't you?" the queen said in a pitying tone.
      "Try again, draw a long breath, and shut your eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice laughed. "There's no use trying," she said.
      "One can't believe impossible things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say you haven't had much practice," said the queen.
      "When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day.
      Why, sometimes I've believed as many as
      <span class="dark">six impossible</span> things before breakfast."
