# Hi.

I'm Gregory Parkhurst. I've been doing various things with and to software
for a long time: C coding (back when the dinosaurs ruled the earth),
MySQL and Oracle database administration and tuning, and lately Ruby & Rails development.
I've met many people I'd call better programmers, but not many more experienced generalists.

Last year I reached a turning point: I decided to become a contributor to open source rather than
remaining primarily a tool-user within closed environments. This led me to
[Mendicant University](/mendicant.html).

# 2012:

I'm looking for a new challenge and closer involvement with a team.
If you're looking for the sort of person who can write and discuss code, tune a database,
provision a server from the ground up, and have a lively and opinionated discussion
about both UI design and the importance of pushing virtualization to the desktop,
perhaps we should talk.

      "I can't believe that!" said Alice.

      "Can't you?" the queen said in a pitying tone.
      "Try again, draw a long breath, and shut your eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice laughed. "There's no use trying," she said.
      "One can't believe impossible things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say you haven't had much practice," said the queen.
      "When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day.
      Why, sometimes I've believed as many as
      <span class="dark">six impossible</span> things before breakfast."
