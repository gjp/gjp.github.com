  <h1>Project: ALDImeals.com</h1>
  <p><em>This site was launched December 2008 and was decommissioned at the end of a multi-year
    promotion, at which point it had over 100k registered users. A

    some

    may still be found online.</em>

  <p>
    The project posed some interesting challenges,
    as the codebase I'd been working with until this point was a Frankenstein's
    monster consisting of proxied Rails apps bolted on to a legacy CGI system
    consisting of dozens of Perl scripts and approximately 8k lines of C code.

    In 2008.

    Also, the client requested a drag-and-drop UI at a time before jQueryUI was
    mature, and the majority of ALDI's customers still used IE6.
  </p>
  <p>I was the dev team, the database guy, the sysadmin, and I'd even built the
    box the site was intended to run on, so I made an executive decision to
    break with the past and port everything to Rails.
  </p>

    </a>
    <p>
      No direct interaction was allowed with the client &ndash; I worked with
      two different marketing companies.
      The core design was provided by a single Photoshop mockup, seen here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near pixel-accurate layout was required.
      Fixed-sized boxes enclosed dynamic content of varying length.
      Nothing on the pages was allowed to flow. Given the constraints,
      tables would have been the easy route here (perhaps the sane one).
      But I <em>really</em> did not want to use tables.
    </p>

    <a href="/images/folio/aldi-homepage.jpg" class="top_up">
      <img class="thumb" src="/images/folio/aldi-homepage_thumb.png" alt="ALDImeals homepage"/>
    </a>
    <p>
      I adjusted colors to reflect the palette used on the
      main ALDI US site and padded dynamic content to help avoid
      layout breakage. The resulting design (captured from the production
      site) was actually quite faithful to the mockup. And no tables!
    </p>
    <p>
      Various fragments of the page were cached in memcached with differing
      timeouts ranging from 5 minutes to an hour, allowing for low overhead on
      a fairly busy page containing multiple dynamic elements and rotating
      banners.

    </a>
    <p>
      A core feature of the site was the drag-and-drop Meal Planner.
      The final design used the entire site width to include three different
      elements: A tabbed cookbook, including both ALDI- and user-selected
      recipes, a calendar spanning one week, and a concise shopping list. Recipe
      titles could be dragged from the cookbook to either the calendar or
      shopping list, and from the calendar to the shopping list.
    </p>

    The guts of the application
    have since been ported to several other sites based on the Radiant CMS as
    well as a web service which is fronted by a .NET-based e-commerce package.
