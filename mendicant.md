# Mendicant University (and beyond)

[Mendicant University](http://mendicantuniversity.org/)
(formerly Ruby Mendicant University) invited me to their
[alumni network](http://school.mendicantuniversity.org/alumni/recent)
after completing their intense and rewarding Core Skills course in September 2011.

This is not your usual academic course. For one thing, it's both free as in
["free beer"](http://majesticseacreature.com/essays/2011/12/28/free-beer-matters.html)
and directed hands-on by Gregory Brown, a guy who
[really knows his stuff](http://rubybestpractices.com/), along with a small staff and former students
who act as mentors.

For another, it's not primarily about book learning: It's about helping a small group of
intermediate-level Ruby programmers through the process of leveraging the open-source collaboration model
to navigate deliberately vague requirements and tight deadlines in order to ship working code,
while simultaneously instilling a sense of community.

Each student works on several projects simultaneously during the course. One is an open-ended personal project. You're required to pitch it, meet your own requirements, and hit the quality checkpoints on time. I worked on a [PDF reformatting tool which guesses new margins based on the position of content](https://github.com/gjp/pdf-barber), created a [cooperative turn-based console game](https://github.com/gjp/s9-e2), and implemented a [digital logic simulation tool](https://github.com/gjp/s9-e3). There's also a requirement to submit a pull request on someone else's project; I experimented with [integrating RedCarpet](https://github.com/sandal/bookie/pull/4/commits) into one of Greg Brown's side projects.

If that sounds like a lot to cover in three weeks, I can assure you it is. And very much worthwhile. :)

Since then I've been focused on finding ways to pay it forward. I made my first
[contribution to Ruby's core documentation](http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-19/repository/revisions/33413),
and have been ramping up my collaboration skills with other Mendicant community projects,
including their their [IRC bot](https://github.com/mendicant-university/mendibot/commits/master?author=gjp)
and their puzzle/admissions site
[PuzzleNode](https://github.com/mendicant-university/puzzlenode/commits/master?author=gjp),
which recently received a shoutout from @JEG2 and [PragDave](http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2012/02/smart-constants.html).
I've also started working with [Mission of Mercy](https://github.com/jordanbyron/mission_of_mercy), a project started
by Jordan Byron to provide management software for free dental clinics, and expect to dig into their RubyFlow-inspired
[community site](http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/) as soon as it's open to collaborators.
