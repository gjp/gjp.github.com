# Mendicant University

[Mendicant University](http://mendicantuniversity.org/)
(formerly Ruby Mendicant University) invited me to their
[alumni network](http://school.mendicantuniversity.org/alumni/recent)
after completing their intense and rewarding Core Skills course in September 2011.

This is not your usual academic course. For one thing, it's free as in
["free beer"](http://majesticseacreature.com/essays/2011/12/28/free-beer-matters.html)
despite being founded by Gregory Brown, a guy who
[really knows his stuff](http://rubybestpractices.com/).

For another, it's not primarily about book learning: It's about helping a small group of
intermediate-level Ruby programmers through the process of leveraging the open-source collaboration model
to navigate deliberately vague requirements and tight deadlines in order to ship high-quality, working code,
while simultaneously instilling a sense of community and social responsibility.

If that sounds like a lot to cover in three weeks, I can assure you it is. And very much worthwhile.

During the course, I worked on
a [PDF reformatting tool which guesses new margins based on the position of content](https://github.com/gjp/pdf-barber),
a [cooperative turn-based console game](https://github.com/gjp/s9-e2), and
a [digital logic simulation tool](https://github.com/gjp/s9-e3).

Since then I've been focused on finding ways to pay it forward. I made my first
[contribution to Ruby's core documentation](http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-19/repository/revisions/33413),
and have been ramping up my collaboration skills with other Mendicant community projects,
including their their [IRC bot](https://github.com/mendicant-university/mendibot/commits/master?author=gjp)
and their puzzle/admissions site
[PuzzleNode](https://github.com/mendicant-university/puzzlenode/commits/master?author=gjp),
which recently received a shoutout from @JEG2 and [PragDave](http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2012/02/smart-constants.html).
I've also started working with [Mission of Mercy](https://github.com/jordanbyron/mission_of_mercy), a project started
by Jordan Byron to provide management software for free dental clinics, and will soon dig into their RubyFlow-inspired
[community site](http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/).
